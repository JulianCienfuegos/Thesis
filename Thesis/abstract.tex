\begin{abstract}
Epithelial tissue is introduced, current models of epithelial development are described, and then a new implementation of a long existing model is presented. The code for the model is thoroughly examined and the algorithms and data structures underlying it are presented. Some topological insights are made about the nature of epithelial tissue, and some discussion of which numerical methods are used is made.
