Epithelial tissue performs many important functions, such as preventing contamination, transporting gases and nutrients, and fluid secretion. Macroscopically, epithelial tissue can be thought of as the layer of an animal that separates it from the exterior world. There are several codes in existence which reproduce certain aspects of epithelial tissue morphogenesis, wound healing, and equilibration, but only one of them are open source projects available to the public. Unfortunately, this code is fairly difficult to install and simulations require a fair amount of patience to design. With this in mind, I have developed \emph{Epithelium},  a lightweight epithelial tissue simulator which compiles easily on any unix like system. The code has very few dependencies, and these dependencies are likely already satisfied by the default packages installed on a Linux or Mac computer. In addition, simulations are fairly easy to design and run via several configuration files, the source code is highly modularized, and the algorithms used therein are extensively documented.As such, this code is useful for reproducing results of past papers, and for quickly designing new experiments.
