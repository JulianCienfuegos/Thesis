\chapter{Chaste}
No discusision of current Epithelial Tissue Simulators woould be complete without a mention of Chaste, the epithelial tissue simulator developed at Oxford. This software is able to reproduce several models of epithelial tissue proliferation and has a large following. The only downside to the Chaste software is the number of dependencies requiered to run this code. Several open source libraries are used( e.g. Boost, PETSc, etc) which must be installed correctly in order for the code to run. In addition, the code will run exclusivley on linux machines, whereas my code can be run on windows with very little modification to the code. 

Here are some images of what the Chaste Software can do.
