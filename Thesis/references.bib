abstract ={Cell-generated forces produce a variety of tissue movements and tissue shape changes. The cytoskeletal elements that underlie these dynamics act at cell–cell and cell–ECM contacts to apply local forces on adhesive structures. In epithelia, force imbalance at cell contacts induces cell shape changes, such as apical constriction or polarized junction remodeling, driving tissue morphogenesis. The dynamics of these processes are well-characterized; however, the mechanical basis of cell shape changes is largely unknown because of a lack of mechanical measurements in vivo. We have developed an approach combining optical tweezers with light-sheet microscopy to probe the mechanical properties of epithelial cell junctions in the early Drosophila embryo. We show that optical trapping can efficiently deform cell–cell interfaces and measure tension at cell junctions, which is on the order of 100 pN. We show that tension at cell junctions equilibrates over a few seconds, a short timescale compared with the contractile events that drive morphogenetic movements. We also show that tension increases along cell interfaces during early tissue morphogenesis and becomes anisotropic as cells intercalate during germ-band extension. By performing pull-and-release experiments, we identify time-dependent properties of junctional mechanics consistent with a simple viscoelastic model. Integrating this constitutive law into a tissue-scale model, we predict quantitatively how local deformations propagate throughout the tissue.},

Spindle orientation in turn controls the placement of daughter cells within a tissue, influencing tissue morphology. Recent findings implicating tumor suppressor proteins in spindle orientation bring to the forefront a connection between spindle misorientation and cancer. In this Commentary, we focus on the role of three major human tumor suppressors – adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), E-cadherin and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) – in spindle orientation. We discuss how, in addition to their better-known functions, these proteins affect microtubule stability and cell polarity, and how their loss of function causes spindles to become misoriented. We also consider how other cancer-associated features, such as oncogene mutations, centrosome amplification and the tumor microenvironment, might influence spindle orientation. Finally, we speculate on the role of spindle misorientation in cancer development and progression. We conclude that spindle misorientation alone is unlikely to be tumorigenic, but it has the potential to synergize with cancer-associated changes to facilitate genomic instability, tissue disorganization, metastasis and expansion of cancer stem cell compartments.},

To preserve tissue architecture and barrier function during both homeostasis and rapid growth, individual epithelial cells divide in a highly constrained manner. Building on decades of research focused on single cells, recent work is probing the mechanisms by which the dynamic process of mitosis is reconciled with the global maintenance of epithelial order during development. These studies reveal how symmetrically dividing cells both exploit and conform to tissue organization to orient their mitotic spindles during division and establish new adhesive junctions during cytokinesis.},
