\caption{Square Cells in Quail Epithelium}

An image or Japanese quail epithelium. This tissue is patterned like a checkerboard and has been modeled in the past as a tissue with degree three vertices. It is possible that modelling this tissue as degree four vertices would provide better approximations of the dynamics.  In particular, notice that the orange vertices clearly can be modeled with degree three, wherease the green vertex could be one degree four vertex or two degree three.\cite{Checkers}
