abstract = "We describe the development, current features, and some directions for future development of the \{AMBER\} package of computer programs. This package has evolved from a program that was constructed to do Assisted Model Building and Energy Refinement to a group of programs embodying a number of the powerful tools of modern computational chemistry-molecular dynamics and free energy calculations.
